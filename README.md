# Demo(s) of using Serilog in .Net 9

This repository is to act as a learning tool and demo for Serilog and logging in general.

This should (hopefully) cover most normal topics and use-cases.

There's a few helpful demo projects under `src/*`; each should be aptly named towards what they're trying to teach.

Additionally, there's a write-ups of what each demo is trying to teach under `docs/*`, plus some extra.

## What's covered so far?

## Contributions

If you want to open a PR to add to this, feel free. This is going to be a sort-of 'living document' as it were.

I think it'd be cool to have others add to it over time; just ask you follow the template stamped out, if you can.
